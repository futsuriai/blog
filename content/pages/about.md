I created this site mainly spurred by the idea of using it as a travel blog for my trip to China and mainly Japan during the beginning of April 2013 but hopefully it'll be useful as a general place to mark down things mainly for myself but others if they care to read about them. I'll probably be writing about topics related to programming, languages -- particularly Japanese as it's what I'm currently studying, kendo, and travels -- when they occur as well as any other updates on my life that are worth sharing. This blog is hosted on [Digital Ocean][] and is maintained using [Pelican][].

And now some basic questions to bring you up to speed:

* * *

### "Where are you now?"

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at [TicketNetwork][] in South Windsor, CT. It's been pretty fun work even if I'm still not particularly passionate about tickets themselves, the technical problems behind the scenes are interesting. Fun people as well which doesn't hurt. Living in Westbrook, CT but given the commute will likely be moving closer, to Hartford, soon.

### "Where are you from?" 

If you asked me that question my most likely response would be to stare at you for around 5 seconds while I tried to figure out what to say. I usually end up answering "Venezuela?" just because it's the easiest answer. The main reason I don't have answer considering how often it has come up is because I don't particularly think any answer is particularly accurate. I don't think of myself as German even if I was born there and lived there until I was about 7, or Venezuelan even if I was raised there and lived there until 18, or Canadian/Quebecer even if I went to university there and lived there until I was 24, or American even if I've been consistently coming to the US throughout my life and am working in the US. I also don't feel particularly French even though I have a French passport (alongside my Venezuelan one) due to family. I think the closest thing I would identify with is some generic concept of western civilization as that's what all the places I've lived in share. 

That's why it's generally easier to answer "Venezuela" with a somewhat questioning tone. 

### "What's this *Futsuriai* thing all about?"

The word is Japanese, [不釣り合い][], where it means something like unbalance. As with many things in life there is a relatively [relevant xkcd] that describes why this word became my online alias. It's the username I started to use when I started use the Internet as a young lad and began signing up for things. At that point I didn't particularly know any Japanese and looked for 'cool' words. It is also connected to a running story some friends and I were working on that never really went anywhere but the name stuck and luckily does not seem to be in use by anyone else on the English Internet which is very convenient. So if you see that username anywhere it's probably me as embarassing or not as the site may be.
