I decided that before my trip to (briefly) China and then Japan I should set up a blog to journal my adventures. To do this I decided to go the easy route and find a hosting provider, configure my server, look through blogging frameworks, customize my templates and styling, and then start posting. 

Ok, so maybe I also wanted to play around with a server to see what I could do with it. After looking around at the options and being somewhat overwhelmed with the places I could host things at, I ended up choosing [Digital Ocean][] mainly because it was pretty cheap and gave me a VPS to play around with. I'd already bought my domain a while ago on a whim though I'd never done anything with it. 

After setting up a [temporary homepage][], I decided to start with setting up the blog itself. I considered a lot of frameworks and was close to going with WordPress just due to its size and community, but in the end decided to go with [Pelican][] as it was written in Python and let me generate a static blog that is easy to edit. 

I'm still not done customizing, but for posterity [here][] is a link to what the blog section looked like when I first wrote this post.

I have around 9 days before I'll be on a plane there. But more on that later as it took me longer than I had planned to to finish setting things up.
